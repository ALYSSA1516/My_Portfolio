  <h1>Commercial Story Board</h1>
  <p>In one of my classes, we were tasked with selecting a company to create a commercial storyboard that effectively integrated their slogan and brand personality. I chose Snickers for this project, inspired by the recent release of *Avengers: Endgame*, which fueled my enthusiasm for Marvel. My storyboard revolved around the concept of a superhero who, amidst a high-stakes battle, begins to lose their composure due to hunger. The tension is humorously alleviated when the hero consumes a Snickers bar, perfectly aligning with the brand’s well-known slogan, “You’re not you when you’re hungry.” I aimed to create an engaging narrative that showcased Snickers’ signature humor and lightheartedness while leveraging the iconic energy and appeal of Marvel characters. By infusing elements of the superhero craze that captivated audiences at the time, I ensured that the storyline not only resonated with viewers but also reinforced Snickers’ playful and approachable brand identity.</p>
