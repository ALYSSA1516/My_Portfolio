<p>For my senior year at the University of Nebraska Lincoln I took a class for Sports Media and Communication. It was my capstone class and we worked with the copany Sporting Kc. We each had groups where we took on roles for the semster. My job was the interactive designer I worked with the art director and copywriter. My major responsibility was interactive advertising, and execution of the agencyâ€™s digital presentation to the client. I created a lot of post we put up on instagram. I helped design the tshirts for our campaign. And created flyers and posters which were handed out and spread across the UNL campus.</p>
