  <h1>Print Ad</h1>
  <p>In one of my classes, I chose Fetch! as the company for a project where I created a Print Ad. My goal was to align the ad with the company’s playful and pet-friendly brand personality. I focused on using bright, engaging colors and imagery that would resonate with pet owners, while keeping the messaging simple yet effective. I made sure to incorporate their logo and brand colors to maintain consistency. Overall, I wanted the ad to reflect Fetch!’s fun, approachable vibe and appeal to their target audience.</p>
